DESCRIPTION:

This script captures logs generated by a Python script and monitors them in real-time. It allows you to gracefully stop the monitoring loop using a signal like Ctrl+C.

# Usage
1. Place your Python script containing the logging code in the same directory as this script.

2. Run the shell script `log-monitor.sh` to start monitoring the logs.
  

  run ./log-monitor.sh

  The script will execute the Python script in the background and redirect its output to a log file named logs.txt. It will then start monitoring this log file for new entries.
To stop the monitoring loop and terminate the script,  " press Ctrl+C ". The script will gracefully stop the monitoring process and clean up the log file.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
Bash shell

#Notes

Ensure that the Python script you want to monitor generates logs using the logging module.
Modify the log-monitor.py placeholder in the shell script with the filename of your Python script.
Make sure both the shell script and the Python script have executable permissions (chmod +x capture_logs.sh).
